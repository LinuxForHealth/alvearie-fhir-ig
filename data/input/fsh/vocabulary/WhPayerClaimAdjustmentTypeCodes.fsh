* #2   "Void (void, reversal or back-out)"                            "A void is a claim line where all financials and quantities are negated"
* #3   "Original or Replacement (original, resubmit or replacement)"  "An original or replacement claim line where all financials and quantities are positive and supplements a void claim line"	
* #4   "Bulk Adjustment (gross or bulk adjustment)"                   "Adjustments (positive or negative) that aren't tied to a particular service at the claim-line level.  Examples include, but aren't limited to, value-based reimbursement payments to providers, Drug Rebates, etc."
* #B   "Adjustment Debit"                                             "Claim adjustments are sometimes required to correct erroneous payments made to providers. Adjustments may need to be made for a range of reasons, for example, recording of an incorrect procedure code, listing of a wrong place of service, data entry errors etc. A claim adjustment debit increases the balance due to the provider due to an underpayment made in error."
